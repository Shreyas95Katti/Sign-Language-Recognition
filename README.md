# Sign-Language-Recognition
Welcome!!

This sign language recognition project was worked on by a very passionate team of three, led and mentored by me. The plan was to assist and advise the special needs community. The project was created from the ground up, and the product is simple to use.

The procedure begins with the generation of a dataset. For better results, the user may demonstrate any hand sign for a certain phrase or word and is requested to capture at least three photographs for each sign. The label mapping must be done after the dataset is complete. Map each image to its matching word meaning or phrase using the "label map" file. We can begin testing the product once all of the pre-processing stages have been completed. You may show any of the indications from the dataset to the module "project training and detection," and it will identify the proper related word or phrase and display it on the screen. Because the entire product is built on a single stereo camera, it is both efficient and cost-effective. I'm particularly excited to add that this solution is cloud-based and accessible to the general public, thanks to the streamlit library.

## Thank You
