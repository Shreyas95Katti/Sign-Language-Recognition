Welcome!!

This sign language recognition project was developed by a passionate team of three, led and mentored by me. Our goal is to assist and support the special needs community. The project was built from the ground up, resulting in a user-friendly product.

## Overview

The process begins with generating a dataset. Users can demonstrate any hand sign for a specific phrase or word and are encouraged to capture at least three images for each sign. After the dataset is complete, label mapping is required. Use the "label map" file to map each image to its corresponding word or phrase. 

Once all preprocessing stages are completed, testing can begin. Users can show any sign from the dataset to the module "project training and detection," which will identify the correct word or phrase and display it on the screen. The entire product relies on a single stereo camera, making it both efficient and cost-effective. Additionally, this solution is cloud-based and accessible to the public, thanks to the Streamlit library.
